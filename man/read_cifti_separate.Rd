\title{Read a CIFTI file with optional resampling}
\usage{
read_cifti_separate(
  cifti_fname,
  surfL_fname = NULL,
  surfR_fname = NULL,
  brainstructures = c("left", "right"),
  resamp_res = NULL,
  sep_keep = FALSE,
  sep_fnames = NULL,
  resamp_keep = FALSE,
  resamp_fnames = NULL,
  write_dir = NULL,
  mwall_values = c(NA, NaN),
  wb_path = NULL,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cifti_fname}{File path of CIFTI-format data (ending in ".d*.nii").}

\item{surfL_fname}{(Optional) File path of GIFTI surface geometry
file representing the left cortex.}

\item{surfR_fname}{(Optional) File path of GIFTI surface geometry
file representing the right cortex.}

\item{brainstructures}{Character vector indicating which brain structure(s) 
 to obtain: \code{"left"} (left cortical surface), \code{"right"} (right 
 cortical surface) and/or \code{"subcortical"} (subcortical and cerebellar
 gray matter). Can also be \code{"all"} (obtain all three brain structures). 
 Default: \code{c("left","right")} (cortical surface only).

 If a brain structure is indicated but does not exist, a warning will be
 raised and that brain structure will be skipped.}

\item{resamp_res}{(Optional) Target resolution for resampling (number of 
cortical surface vertices per hemisphere). If \code{NULL} (default) or 
\code{FALSE}, do not perform resampling.}

\item{sep_keep}{If separated files are created, should they be kept or 
deleted at the end of this function call? Default: \code{FALSE} (delete).
Keeping the separated files may help speed up certain tasks, for example
when repeatedly iterating over subjects--the CIFTI will only be separated
once instead of at each iteration.}

\item{sep_fnames}{(Optional) Where to write the separated files (override
 their default file names). This is a named list 
 where each entry's name is a file type label, and each entry's value
 is a file name indicating where to write the corresponding separated file. 
 The recognized file type labels are: "cortexL", "cortexR", 
 "ROIcortexL", "ROIcortexR", "subcortVol", and "subcortLabs".
 
 Entry values can be \code{NULL}, in which case a default file name will be 
 used: see \code{\link{cifti_component_suffix}}. Default file names
 will also be used for files that need to be separated/written but without a
 corresponding entry in \code{sep_fnames}.
 
 Entries in \code{sep_fnames} will be ignored if they are not needed
 based on \code{[ROI_]brainstructures}. For example, if
 \code{brainstructures="left"}, then \code{sep_fnames$cortexR} will be 
 ignored if specified. 

 The \code{write_dir} argument can be used to place each separated file in
 the same directory.}

\item{resamp_keep}{If resampled files are created, will they be kept or 
deleted at the end of this function call? Default: \code{FALSE} (delete).
Keeping the resampled files may help speed up certain tasks, for example
when repeatedly iterating over CIFTI files--resampling will only be done
once instead of every new iteration.}

\item{resamp_fnames}{Where to write the resampled files. This is a named list 
 where each entry's name is a file type label, and each entry's value
 is a file name indicating where to write the corresponding resampled file. 
 The recognized file type labels are: "cortexL", "cortexR", 
 "ROIcortexL", "ROIcortexR", "validROIcortexL", and "validROIcortexR".
 
 Entry values can be \code{NULL}, in which case a default file name will be 
 used: see \code{\link{resample_cifti_default_fname}}. Default file names
 will also be used for files that need to be resampled/written but without a
 corresponding entry in \code{resamp_fnames}.
 
 Entries in \code{resamp_fnames} will be ignored if they are not needed
 based on \code{[ROI_]brainstructures}. For example, if
 \code{brainstructures="left"}, then \code{resamp_fnames$cortexR} will be 
 ignored if specified. 

 The \code{write_dir} argument can be used to place each resampled file in
 the same directory.}

\item{write_dir}{Where should any output files be written? \code{NULL}
 (default) will write them to the current working directory.

 Files flagged for deletion will be written to a temporary directory, and
 thus are not affected by this argument. So if \code{sep_keep} is 
 \code{TRUE}, the separated files will be written to \code{write_dir}, but if
 \code{sep_keep} is \code{FALSE}, they will be written to \code{tempdir()} 
 and later deleted. \code{resamp_keep} works similarly. 

 For \code{read_cifti_separate}, the surface files (\code{surfL} or \code{surfR})
 are deleted if \code{resamp_keep} is \code{FALSE}, so in this case they will
 be written to \code{tempdir()}. But for \code{resample_cifti}, the
 surface files are kept even if \code{resamp_keep} is \code{FALSE}, so they 
 will always be written to \code{write_dir}. 

 Different subfolders for the separated, resampled, and final output files
 cannot be specified by \code{write_dir}. Instead, modify the individual file
 names in \code{sep_fnames} and \code{resamp_fnames}.

 \code{write_dir} must already exist, or an error will occur.}

\item{mwall_values}{If the medial wall locations are not indicated in the
CIFTI, use these values to infer the medial wall mask. Default: 
\code{c(NA, NaN)}. If \code{NULL}, do not attempt to infer the medial wall.}

\item{wb_path}{(Optional) Path to Connectome Workbench folder or executable. 
If not provided, should be set with 
\code{ciftiTools.setOption("wb_path", "path/to/workbench")}.}

\item{verbose}{Should occasional updates be printed? Default: \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
A \code{"xifti"} object. See \code{\link{is.xifti}}.

\description{
Read a CIFTI file by writing each component into a GIFTI and NIFTI file
 (\code{\link{separate_cifti}}), optionally resampling the GIFTIs, 
 (\code{\link{resample_gifti}}), and then reading each separated 
 component into R (\code{\link{make_xifti}}). Surfaces can also be provided; 
 they will be resampled along with the CIFTI for viewing.
}
\details{
The subcortical component (NIFTI) is not resampled.

\section{Connectome Workbench Requirement}{

 This function uses a system wrapper for the 'wb_command' executable. The 
 user must first download and install the Connectome Workbench, available 
 from https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench . 
 The \code{wb_path} argument is the full file path to the Connectome 
 Workbench folder. (The full file path to the 'wb_cmd' executable also 
 works.)
