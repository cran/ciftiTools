 This function opens an interactive Open GL window rendered by \code{rgl}. 
 If \code{save==TRUE} and \code{close_after_save==TRUE}, the window will be
 closed after the function call. Otherwise, it is kept open and the following
 information applies:

 To navigate the plot, left click and drag the cursor to rotate. Use the 
 scroll wheel or right click and drag to zoom. Press the scroll wheel and drag
 to change the field-of-view. Execute \code{\link[rgl]{snapshot}} to save the
 current window as a .png file. Execute \code{\link[rgl:rgl.open]{rgl.close}} to close
 the window. \code{\link[rgl:viewpoint]{rgl.viewpoint}} can be used for programmatic
 navigation. 

 The Open GL window can be embedded as an htmlwidget in an R Markdown document
 using one of two methods. The first is executing \code{\link[rgl]{rglwidget}}
 in the chunk where the plot is made. This first method should work within
 both the RStudio IDE and a knitted .html file. The second method is 
 executing \code{\link[rgl:hook_rgl]{setupKnitr}} at the start of the document and 
 then using the chunk option \code{webgl=TRUE} in the chunk where the plot is
 made. The second method is specifically for knitted .html files. Although
 the first method is the newest approach and is recommended by others, we
 used the second method in the \code{ciftiTools} vignette because the first
 is not compatible with htmlpreview. For both methods, the window still
 needs to be open to render the widget. Also for both methods, you will 
 probably need to tweak the image dimensions e.g. 
 \code{fig.width=8, fig.height=5} in the chunk options, because it uses the 
 defaults from RMarkdown/Knitr instead of what makes sense based on the 
 dimensions of the Open GL window.
 
 For \code{view_xifti_surface}, if \code{length(idx) > 1}, this function will
 automaticaly return an htmlwidget using the first method, but with a
 \code{\link[rgl]{playwidget}} wrapper to add a slider to control which
 column index is being displayed. All the meshes will be rendered on top of
 one another in the Open GL window, so only the widget will be useful for
 viewing the data interactively. Since it uses the first method, it will not
 be visible with htmlpreview. No additional call to 
 \code{\link[rgl]{rglwidget}} is necessary, but \code{\link[rgl:rgl.open]{rgl.close}}
 must be called in a following chunk to close the Open GL window.
