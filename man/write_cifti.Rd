\item{xifti}{Object of class "xifti". 
See \code{\link{is.xifti}} and \code{\link{make_xifti}}.}

\item{cifti_fname}{File path of CIFTI-format data (ending in ".d*.nii").}

\item{surfL_fname, surfR_fname}{If the [left/right] surface is present, it 
will be a written to a GIFTI file at this file path. If \code{NULL} 
(default), do not write out the surface.}

\item{verbose}{Should occasional updates be printed? Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{wb_path}{(Optional) Path to Connectome Workbench folder or executable. 
If not provided, should be set with 
\code{ciftiTools.setOption("wb_path", "path/to/workbench")}.}
}
\value{
Named character vector of the written files

\description{
Write out a \code{"xifti"} object as a CIFTI file and (optionally) GIFTI 
 surface files.

\section{Connectome Workbench Requirement}{

 This function uses a system wrapper for the 'wb_command' executable. The 
 user must first download and install the Connectome Workbench, available 
 from https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench . 
 The \code{wb_path} argument is the full file path to the Connectome 
 Workbench folder. (The full file path to the 'wb_cmd' executable also 
 works.)
