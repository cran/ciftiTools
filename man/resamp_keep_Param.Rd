\arguments{
\item{resamp_keep}{If resampled files are created, will they be kept or 
deleted at the end of this function call? Default: \code{FALSE} (delete).
Keeping the resampled files may help speed up certain tasks, for example
when repeatedly iterating over CIFTI files--resampling will only be done
once instead of every new iteration.}
