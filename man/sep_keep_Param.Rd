\arguments{
\item{sep_keep}{If separated files are created, should they be kept or 
deleted at the end of this function call? Default: \code{FALSE} (delete).
Keeping the separated files may help speed up certain tasks, for example
when repeatedly iterating over subjects--the CIFTI will only be separated
once instead of at each iteration.}
