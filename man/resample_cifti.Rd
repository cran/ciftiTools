\arguments{
\item{cifti_original_fname}{A CIFTI file to resample.}

\item{cifti_target_fname}{The file name to save the resampled CIFTI.}

\item{surfL_original_fname, surfR_original_fname}{(Optional) File path of 
existing GIFTI surface geometry file representing the left/right cortex. 
One or both can be provided. These will be resampled too, and are convenient
for visualizing the resampled data.}

\item{surfL_target_fname, surfR_target_fname}{(Optional) File path for
the resampled GIFTI surface geometry file representing the left/right 
cortex. If NULL (default), will use default names: see 
\code{resample_cifti_default_fname}.}

\item{resamp_res}{Target resolution for resampling (number of 
cortical surface vertices per hemisphere).}

\item{sep_keep}{If separated files are created, should they be kept or 
deleted at the end of this function call? Default: \code{FALSE} (delete).
Keeping the separated files may help speed up certain tasks, for example
when repeatedly iterating over subjects--the CIFTI will only be separated
once instead of at each iteration.}

\item{sep_fnames}{(Optional) Where to write the separated files (override
 their default file names). This is a named list 
 where each entry's name is a file type label, and each entry's value
 is a file name indicating where to write the corresponding separated file. 
 The recognized file type labels are: "cortexL", "cortexR", 
 "ROIcortexL", "ROIcortexR", "subcortVol", and "subcortLabs".
 
 Entry values can be \code{NULL}, in which case a default file name will be 
 used: see \code{\link{cifti_component_suffix}}. Default file names
 will also be used for files that need to be separated/written but without a
 corresponding entry in \code{sep_fnames}.
 
 Entries in \code{sep_fnames} will be ignored if they are not needed
 based on \code{[ROI_]brainstructures}. For example, if
 \code{brainstructures="left"}, then \code{sep_fnames$cortexR} will be 
 ignored if specified. 

 The \code{write_dir} argument can be used to place each separated file in
 the same directory.}

\item{resamp_keep}{If resampled files are created, will they be kept or 
deleted at the end of this function call? Default: \code{FALSE} (delete).
Keeping the resampled files may help speed up certain tasks, for example
when repeatedly iterating over CIFTI files--resampling will only be done
once instead of every new iteration.}

\item{resamp_fnames}{Where to write the resampled files. This is a named list 
 where each entry's name is a file type label, and each entry's value
 is a file name indicating where to write the corresponding resampled file. 
 The recognized file type labels are: "cortexL", "cortexR", 
 "ROIcortexL", "ROIcortexR", "validROIcortexL", and "validROIcortexR".
 
 Entry values can be \code{NULL}, in which case a default file name will be 
 used: see \code{\link{resample_cifti_default_fname}}. Default file names
 will also be used for files that need to be resampled/written but without a
 corresponding entry in \code{resamp_fnames}.
 
 Entries in \code{resamp_fnames} will be ignored if they are not needed
 based on \code{[ROI_]brainstructures}. For example, if
 \code{brainstructures="left"}, then \code{resamp_fnames$cortexR} will be 
 ignored if specified. 

 The \code{write_dir} argument can be used to place each resampled file in
 the same directory.}

\item{write_dir}{Where should any output files be written? \code{NULL}
 (default) will write them to the current working directory.

 Files flagged for deletion will be written to a temporary directory, and
 thus are not affected by this argument. So if \code{sep_keep} is 
 \code{TRUE}, the separated files will be written to \code{write_dir}, but if
 \code{sep_keep} is \code{FALSE}, they will be written to \code{tempdir()} 
 and later deleted. \code{resamp_keep} works similarly. 

 For \code{read_cifti_separate}, the surface files (\code{surfL} or \code{surfR})
 are deleted if \code{resamp_keep} is \code{FALSE}, so in this case they will
 be written to \code{tempdir()}. But for \code{resample_cifti}, the
 surface files are kept even if \code{resamp_keep} is \code{FALSE}, so they 
 will always be written to \code{write_dir}. 

 Different subfolders for the separated, resampled, and final output files
 cannot be specified by \code{write_dir}. Instead, modify the individual file
 names in \code{sep_fnames} and \code{resamp_fnames}.

 \code{write_dir} must already exist, or an error will occur.}

\item{mwall_values}{If the medial wall locations are not indicated in the
 CIFTI, use these values to infer the medial wall mask. Default: 
 \code{c(NA, NaN)}. If \code{NULL}, do not attempt to infer the medial wall.

 Correctly indicating the medial wall locations is important for resampling,
 because the medial wall mask is taken into account during resampling
 calculations.}

\item{verbose}{Should occasional updates be printed? Default: \code{TRUE}.}

\item{wb_path}{(Optional) Path to Connectome Workbench folder or executable. 
If not provided, should be set with 
\code{ciftiTools.setOption("wb_path", "path/to/workbench")}.}
}
\value{
A named character vector of written files: \code{"cifti"} and
 potentially \code{"surfL"} (if \code{surfL_original_fname} was provided) 
 and/or \code{"surfR"} (if \code{surfR_original_fname} was provided).
}
\description{
Performs spatial resampling of CIFTI data on the cortical surface
 by separating it into GIFTI and NIFTI files, resampling the GIFTIs, and then 
 putting them together. (The subcortex is not resampled.)
}
\section{Connectome Workbench Requirement}{

 This function uses a system wrapper for the 'wb_command' executable. The 
 user must first download and install the Connectome Workbench, available 
 from https://www.humanconnectome.org/software/get-connectome-workbench . 
 The \code{wb_path} argument is the full file path to the Connectome 
 Workbench folder. (The full file path to the 'wb_cmd' executable also 
 works.)
